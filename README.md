## About this project...

Using Javascript -- plotly and D3.js -- as well as HTML and CSS, I have created an interactive dashboard of data collected during a belly button bacteria experiment. The dashboard allows a user to select a particular row of data from the dataset pertaining to particular test subject. By chosing a test subject ID from the a dropdown, 4 different charts on the page are updated: a description of the subject, a bar chart of the top 10 bacteria OTUs, their belly button washing frequency in a gauge chart, and a bubble chart clustering the bacteria by size and coloring each OTU set similarly. and this action updates 4 different charts on the page: a description of the subject, a bar chart of the top 10 bacteria OTUs, their belly button washing frequency in a gauge chart, and a bubble chart clustering the bacteria by size and coloring each OTU set similarly.
